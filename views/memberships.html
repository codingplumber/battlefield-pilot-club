    <p>These intangible values are essential to the culture of Pilot International. They enable us to survive as an organization, and to draw additional members who are inspired by and committed to the work we perform in our communities. Pilot's values have been formed and polished over the last 70 years, beginning with the first club in Macon and eventually traveling to over 500 clubs around the world.</p>
